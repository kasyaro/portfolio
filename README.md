# portfolio

# SETUP 
1. created folder on a Desctop "portfolio"
2. created a new repo on GitHUb => named portfolio , and initialized with readme => "create repository" redirect me to the page where I have 2 options . In that case I choose option #1. : Making a repo on Github first and cloning it locally
3. prees "clone-download button" => that will save url to your mouse.
4. in your terminal ( inside portfolio folder )run a command: 
  git clone *paste copied url here*

=> this will initialize your local folder with git repo. It automatically created another folder with the name you gave in your gitHub for your repo ("portfolio"). You can check inside this folder and it should contain README file.

5. inside your porfolio folder(that is a git repo) run commands in terminal: 
touch index.html app.js style.css

 => that will create files you will work in. 

 6. index.html => boiler plate fro html 5
